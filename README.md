# 📌 Fine-Tuning GPT-2 — Classification & Instruction Fine-Tuning

## 📖 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to **fine-tune a GPT-2 model** for two different purposes:

1. **Text Classification Fine-Tuning** — Example: Spam vs. Not Spam detection.
2. **Instruction Fine-Tuning** — Modifying GPT-2 to follow instructions like a question-answering model.

Fine-tuning is the process of **adapting a pre-trained model** to a specific task by training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset.  
It allows us to leverage the general language understanding of large models while making them perform exceptionally well on our target problem.

## 🔹 Types of Fine-Tuning

### 1️⃣ Classification Fine-Tuning
**Definition:**  
Classification fine-tuning is when we adapt a model to assign input text to predefined categories.  
Instead of generating free-form text, the model learns to output labels such as *Spam* or *Not Spam*.

**Example in this repo:**  
- **Folder:** `Sapm&NotSpam`
- **Contents:**  
  - A folder "sms_spam_collection" containing the data Set.
  - A Jupyter Notebook showing how to fine-tune GPT-2 for spam detection.
  - The notebook walks through:
    - Preparing the dataset.
    - Tokenizing the text.
    - Fine-tuning GPT-2 for binary classification.
    - Evaluating the model.

### 2️⃣ Instruction Fine-Tuning
**Definition:**  
Instruction fine-tuning is when we modify a model to **follow human instructions** or **answer questions** more effectively.  
Instead of simply predicting the next token, the model is trained to produce outputs that align with a given command or prompt.

**Example in this repo:**  
- **Folder:** `Instruction finetuning`
- **Contents:**  
  - Training data formatted as instruction–response pairs.
  - A Jupyter Notebook showing how to adapt GPT-2 for question-answer tasks.
  - Steps include:
    - Formatting the dataset for instruction-response training.
    - Adjusting the GPT-2 architecture if needed.
    - Fine-tuning to make GPT-2 act like a Q&A model.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Fine-tuning allows you to specialize GPT-2 for specific tasks.
- **Classification fine-tuning** → Model learns to categorize text.
- **Instruction fine-tuning** → Model learns to follow instructions or answer questions.
